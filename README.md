<p align="left"> I'm Hamza from Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK and currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University Of Sunderland. I enjoy creating UI/UX designs and wireframing websites. As of now, I am in search for a placement to broaden my knowledge and get a feel of what it's like working in industry. </p>
